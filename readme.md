The actual password generator code "Edward" @ https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/233715/random-password-generator-in-c (original post: Dec 9 '19 at 18:40)
I did the password lenght code that detects if any parameters were given to be the lenght of the password (default is 8 if no parameter is given). 

My goals on this project were:

- to have a handy little password generator. 
- to learn some C after a decade hiatus.
- to learn how to code a program for Linux terminal with parameters. 
- to have the source file to be as small as possible.
